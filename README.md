**A novel multimodal fusion deep network for identifying hillside urban expansion**

---

## üåç Introduction
HUE is a deep learning framework designed for accurate identification of Hillside Urban Expansion (HUE).
By integrating multimodal data and leveraging spatial‚Äìfrequency domain fusion, HUE effectively mitigates confusion with mountainous elements and improves urban expansion detection in complex terrains.
