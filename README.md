# HUENet

**A novel multimodal fusion deep network for identifying hillside urban expansion**

---

## üåç Introduction
HUENet is a deep learning framework designed for accurate identification of Hillside Urban Expansion (HUE).
By integrating multimodal data (RGB+Slope+RA+NTL+CCDC) and leveraging spatial‚Äìfrequency domain fusion, HUENet effectively mitigates confusion with mountainous elements and improves urban detection in complex terrains.
